# tilt-3d
A smooth 3D tilt JavaScript + TypeScript library

## Installation

npm install tilt-3d
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { Tilt3d } from 'tilt-3d';

const elements = document.querySelectorAll(".tilt-3d");

Tilt3d.init(elements)
```

## Options
```js
{
    reverse:                false,  // reverse the tilt direction
    max:                    15,     // max tilt rotation (degrees)
    startX:                 0,      // the starting tilt on the X axis, in degrees.
    startY:                 0,      // the starting tilt on the Y axis, in degrees.
    perspective:            1000,   // Transform perspective, the lower the more extreme the tilt gets.
    scale:                  1,      // 2 = 200%, 1.5 = 150%, etc..
    speed:                  300,    // Speed of the enter/exit transition
    transition:             true,   // Set a transition on enter/exit.
    axis:                   null,   // What axis should be enabled. Can be "x" or "y".
    reset:                  true,   // If the tilt effect has to be reset on exit.
    "reset-to-start":       true,   // Whether the exit reset will go to [0,0] (default) or [startX, startY]
    easing:                 "cubic-bezier(.03,.98,.52,.99)",    // Easing on enter/exit.
    glare:                  false,  // if it should have a "glare" effect
    "max-glare":            1,      // the maximum "glare" opacity (1 = 100%, 0.5 = 50%)
    "glare-prerender":      false,  // false = VanillaTilt creates the glare elements for you, otherwise
                                    // you need to add .js-tilt-glare>.js-tilt-glare-inner by yourself
    "mouse-event-element":  null,   // css-selector or link to an HTML-element that will be listening to mouse events
    "full-page-listening":  false,  // If true, parallax effect will listen to mouse move events on the whole document, not only the selected element
    gyroscope:              true,   // Boolean to enable/disable device orientation detection,
    gyroscopeMinAngleX:     -45,    // This is the bottom limit of the device angle on X axis, meaning that a device rotated at this angle would tilt the element as if the mouse was on the left border of the element;
    gyroscopeMaxAngleX:     45,     // This is the top limit of the device angle on X axis, meaning that a device rotated at this angle would tilt the element as if the mouse was on the right border of the element;
    gyroscopeMinAngleY:     -45,    // This is the bottom limit of the device angle on Y axis, meaning that a device rotated at this angle would tilt the element as if the mouse was on the top border of the element;
    gyroscopeMaxAngleY:     45,     // This is the top limit of the device angle on Y axis, meaning that a device rotated at this angle would tilt the element as if the mouse was on the bottom border of the element;
    gyroscopeSamples:       10      // How many gyroscope moves to decide the starting position.
}
